# RansomPy

A demo script written in python to show how ransomware works. The encrypt script generates a key file called key.txt and then encrypts all files within the same folder (except encrypt.py, key.txt and decrypt.py) using the key. The files can be restored by using the decrypt.py file and entering the password 'lasershark'.

Use at your own risk, no warranty provided etc. etc.

This script has only been tested to work on linux, to encrypt text files.
